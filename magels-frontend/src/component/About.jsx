      It started when my wife brought some pasalubong from work - Polvoron. 
      I noticed that it was unique, aside from classic it has cookies and cream as variant. It was tasty and delicous.
      I asked my wife where she bough it, but she said, it was just given by thier boss to them. 
      At that moment, I've been thinking for a small business that I can start in our humble and small kitchen in our apartment. 
      I researched on how to make Polvoron, and I thought that the this is something I can enjoy and manage. 
      Then, after producing the prior batches, I received helpful feedbacks to improve my product - taste, texture, size, price, and packaging.
      It was on my sixth batch attempt when most consumer started to compliment the Polvorons and and I kept that recipe to cater the preferences of 
      my customers - I want them to enjoy it!
